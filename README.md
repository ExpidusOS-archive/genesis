# Genesis

Genesis Shell is a modular Wayland compositor based on Wayfire. The name "Genesis" was chosen as the shell is designed to be a "next-generation"
desktop environment. It is designed to be modular, the core of the shell is designed to not rely on any display backends. This means Genesis can be ported
between any display technology with little hassle.
